<p>
This list is not exhaustive and may contain mistakes/errors. Accuracy is only
guaranteed at 90% and is generated to inform developers about which CPAN
modules are currently out of date in portage. Our most frequent bug request is
for module bumping. This list is intended as acknowledgement (and hopefully
will curb some of the bugs to boot).
