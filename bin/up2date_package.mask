# This file can be used to mask packages so that even if there
# are updates available on cpan the update will not be listed.
#
# The operators "=", ">" and ">=" are available and work pretty
# much the same as in the package.mask file used by portage.
#
# Example to block all packages greater than given:
# >dev-perl/foo-0.123

#=dev-perl/Video-Info-0.999
#=dev-perl/Unix-Syslog-0.99

# Broken per bug #198698
#=dev-perl/WWW-Bugzilla-1*

# upstream: old version is 1.0.14, newer is 1.01
# gentoo: only have 1.01
=dev-perl/Class-MakeMethods-1.014

# CPAN version madness
=dev-perl/Class-DBI-3.06

# No need to update
=dev-perl/SVN-Simple-0.28
=dev-perl/File-chdir-0.1004
=dev-perl/Mail-ListDetector-1.03

# Only test changes, which we don't run
