# This file can be used to mask packages so that even if there
# are updates available on cpan the update will not be listed.
#
# The operators "=", ">" and ">=" are available and work pretty
# much the same as in the package.mask file used by portage.
#
# Example to block all packages greater than given:
# >dev-perl/foo-0.123
